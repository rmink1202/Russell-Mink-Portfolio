                <p><Span class="about_info">About Me:</Span> I have always been a curious person. I love understanding how
                    things work.  Mostly, I enjoy taking my knowledge of how things work and creating; rather that be a model,
                    programming, website building, or simply drawing.  I enjoy seeing my creations being used and appreciated.  I graduated
                    from South University Summa Cum Laude with an A.S in computer science.  While in school, I studied networking,
                    coputer logic, human-computer interface, progamming (C#.net), and web-design and development.  Since graduation,
                    I have been working as an Information System Specialist for manufacturing.  In the heart of me though, 
                    continues the urge to create, learn, and share my creations.  Reflecting on my experiences in school and
                    work, I have found that coding and programming are the things that I enjoy most.  I am not afraid to learn
                    and love to solve problems as part of the learning experience; making the end result all the more rewarding.
                    One day, I hope to be a full time software engineer or web-developer for the above reasons.  I continue
                     my education of various computer languages, technologies, and industry standards via self learning (code-camps, etc.)
                     to hopefully open the door to my goal.

                the user to scan barcodes that meet certain criteria.  This scan is transferred to a database via an API on a local virtual machine.
            The scan records location, time and date of interactions.  This is used to track certain goods through the process 
        for quality.</p>

                into the final leg of the course.  I will be making a Reddit Client as an web App as one of my final projects for this course.
            I look forward to posting this App in my github repository along side any other projects I will be working on.</p>
